# Voltage-generation-using-Thermocouple-in-Simulink
This project involves the development of a simulation model for a wearable mobile charging system using thermocouples, created in MATLAB and Simulink. The concept is designed to harness body heat or environmental temperature differences—such as during winter or summer—by embedding thermocouples into a jacket.
